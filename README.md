# bitters-compass

This project is a repackaging of thoughtbot's [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) as a compass project.
I try to keep it in sync and up to date with Bitters.

## Installation

`gem install bitters-compass`

In your Compass config file: `require 'bitters-compass'`.

In your Sass file: `@import 'bitters/bitters'`.
